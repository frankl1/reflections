What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When I initialize a repository, it create a .git directory, which is the git repository in my directory.I do it when I want to be able to use git features on files and folders in a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area contains files from the working directory that are going to be in the next commit. It help to create the logical unit of the next commit.
