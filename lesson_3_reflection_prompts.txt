When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
    I would use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local when I'm not working alone on that work, when I
    need collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather that having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository

	Because I want to have control over my local work and decide myself when I want new data from the remote server. Beside that, automatic pulling can make my local repository unavaillable when there are many changes on the remote server at many times.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- clones is used to make a copy of remote or local repository
	- forks is a kind of clone offered by GitHub and work only on GitHub
	- branches is a set related commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If the remote is having a problem introduce by may be a collaborator, a virus, it could be restore using the local save. Else where you can continuous your local work according to latest work on the remote as it's saved locally
