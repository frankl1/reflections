When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
    I would use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local when I'm not working alone on that work, when I
    need collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather that having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository

	Because I want to have control over my local work and decide myself when I want new data from the remote server. Beside that, automatic pulling can make my local repository unavaillable when there are many changes on the remote server at many times.
